## Logging of ANR and FC Events

If you experience an "Application Not Responding", or "Forced Close" event while using
TangoCamera, you may be asked for permission to upload a crash report. If you agree,
some information about the crash will be uploaded. This information is designed to not
contain any personally identifiable information, but may include information such as
the stack trace of what the program was trying to do when it crashed, as well as
limited information about your device's software (such as version information).

for the image.
